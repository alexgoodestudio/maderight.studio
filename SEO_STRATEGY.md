## 🎯 Next Steps to Outrank Them

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (This Week)

#### 1. Google Business Profile
**Priority:** CRITICAL
- [ ] Claim/create Google Business Profile for "Made Right Studio"
- [ ] Category: "Web Design Company" or "Website Designer"
- [ ] Add Columbia, SC location
- [ ] Add business description (same as meta description)
- [ ] Upload logo and portfolio images
- [ ] Get first 3-5 reviews from clients

**Why this matters:** Local SEO signals are crucial for geographic searches. This directly competes with maderightstudio.com's lack of local presence in Columbia.

#### 2. Submit to Search Engines
- [ ] Submit sitemap to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
- [ ] Submit sitemap to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters)

#### 3. Social Media Consistency

### Phase 2: Content Strategy (Next 2 Weeks)

#### Portfolio/Case Studies
Create 3-5 dedicated portfolio pages:
- [ ] Page 1: E-commerce website you built

- [ ] Include client testimonials
- [ ] Add project details (tech stack, challenges, solutions)

**URL structure:** `maderight.studio/work/[project-name]`
