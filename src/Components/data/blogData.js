        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Building SEO Into Your Site Architecture</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Search engine optimization works best when it's built into your website from the ground up, not added as an afterthought. Think of it like building a house—you don't add the foundation after the walls are up. The same principle applies to SEO: your site's structure, performance, and content strategy need to work together from the start.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          For small businesses in Columbia and beyond, effective SEO means being found by customers actively searching for what you offer. Here's how we approach it at Made Right Studio.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Technical SEO: The Foundation</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Before you write a single word of content, your website needs to be technically sound. Search engines prioritize sites that load quickly, work seamlessly on mobile devices, and follow best practices for accessibility.
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Page Speed and Core Web Vitals</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Google measures how fast your site loads and how stable it feels while loading. These metrics—called Core Web Vitals—directly impact your rankings. A slow site doesn't just frustrate users; it actively hurts your visibility.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">
            Key optimization strategies:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Image optimization:</strong> Convert images to modern formats like WebP, compress file sizes, and lazy-load images that aren't immediately visible</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Minimize JavaScript:</strong> Each plugin and script adds loading time. We use React and Vite to create lean, efficient code</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Preload critical assets:</strong> Fonts and hero images load first to prevent layout shifts and text flashing</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Content Delivery Networks:</strong> Serve files from servers geographically close to your users for faster load times</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Mobile-First Design</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Google ranks your website based on its mobile version, not desktop. Over 60% of searches happen on phones, so your mobile experience needs to be flawless. This goes beyond making things fit on smaller screens.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Mobile optimization includes touch-friendly navigation, forms that work with phone keyboards, appropriately sized tap targets, and images that load efficiently on cellular connections. We build with Bootstrap's responsive grid system to ensure every element adapts intelligently across device sizes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Clean HTML Structure</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Search engines read your site's code to understand what each page is about. Proper HTML structure—using semantic tags like header, nav, main, and article—helps search engines interpret your content correctly.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            This means one H1 tag per page (your main heading), logical H2-H6 subheadings that organize content, and descriptive alt text for every image. These practices also improve accessibility for screen readers.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Content Strategy That Gets Found</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Understanding Search Intent</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Effective SEO starts with understanding what your customers are actually searching for. Someone searching "coffee shop near me" has different intent than someone searching "how to brew pour-over coffee." Your content needs to match what people want to find.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            For local businesses, this means incorporating location-specific terms naturally. "Columbia SC coffee shop" matters more than generic phrases. We research the exact language your customers use, then build that into your content without keyword stuffing.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Strategic Keyword Placement</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Once you know what people search for, those terms need to appear in specific places: page titles, headings, the first paragraph, image descriptions, and meta descriptions. But this should read naturally—write for humans first, optimize for search engines second.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2">
            Key locations for keywords:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Title tags:</strong> The clickable headline in search results (keep under 60 characters)</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Meta descriptions:</strong> The preview text below your title (under 155 characters)</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>H1 and H2 headings:</strong> Your main and section headings</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>First 100 words:</strong> Search engines weight early content more heavily</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Image alt text:</strong> Descriptive text for images that helps accessibility and SEO</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">URL Structure and Site Navigation</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Clean URLs help both users and search engines understand your site structure. Instead of example.com/page?id=47, use descriptive paths like example.com/services/web-design. URLs should be lowercase, hyphen-separated, and reflect your content hierarchy.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Internal linking matters too. Every page should be reachable within three clicks from your homepage. This helps search engines discover all your content and distributes page authority throughout your site.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Local SEO for Columbia Businesses</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Google Business Profile Optimization</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            For local businesses, your Google Business Profile is crucial. Complete every section: business description, hours, services, photos. Encourage customer reviews and respond to them. Keep your NAP (Name, Address, Phone) information consistent across all platforms.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Regular updates signal to Google that your business is active. Post about events, promotions, or new products. Upload high-quality photos of your location, products, and team.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Local Content and Community Connection</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Creating content about Columbia-specific topics builds local relevance. Blog posts about neighborhood events, partnerships with other local businesses, or guides to the area all strengthen your local SEO.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Location pages work well if you serve multiple areas. Create dedicated pages for each neighborhood or city you serve, with unique content for each—not duplicate text with just the city name changed.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Schema Markup for Local Businesses</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Schema markup is structured data that tells search engines exactly what your business offers. For local businesses, this includes your address, phone number, hours, and service area. When implemented correctly, this information can appear as rich results in search.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            We implement JSON-LD schema markup for local businesses, including organization details, location information, and service offerings. This helps search engines display your business information accurately in local search results.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Content That Builds Authority</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Quality Over Quantity</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            One well-researched, comprehensive page performs better than ten thin pages with minimal content. Google rewards depth and expertise. If you're writing about a topic, cover it thoroughly. Answer the questions your customers actually have.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            This doesn't mean every page needs to be 3,000 words. A service page might be 500 words if it clearly explains what you offer, who it's for, and why someone should choose you. A blog post exploring a complex topic might need 2,000 words to be comprehensive.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Regular Updates and Fresh Content</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Search engines favor sites that publish regularly. This doesn't mean daily blog posts—consistency matters more than frequency. One valuable blog post per month beats ten rushed posts that don't serve your audience.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Update existing content too. If you have a popular page that's a year old, refresh it with new information, updated statistics, or improved formatting. Updated dates signal fresh content to search engines.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Visual Content and Multimedia</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Images, videos, and infographics improve user engagement—and Google tracks how long people stay on your pages. Visual content keeps visitors engaged longer, which signals quality to search engines.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Every image needs descriptive alt text, both for accessibility and SEO. File names matter too—use descriptive names like "columbia-coffee-shop-interior.jpg" instead of "IMG_1234.jpg".
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Measuring What Matters</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Google Search Console</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            This free tool shows exactly how people find your site: which queries bring traffic, which pages rank well, and where you have technical issues. Monitor your Core Web Vitals, check for crawl errors, and identify opportunities for improvement.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Pay attention to click-through rates. If a page ranks well but gets few clicks, your title or description might need improvement. If pages aren't ranking at all, you might be targeting keywords that are too competitive.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Analytics and User Behavior</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Traffic numbers mean nothing if visitors immediately leave. Track bounce rates, time on page, and conversion rates. These metrics reveal whether your content actually serves the people who find it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Set up goal tracking for important actions: contact form submissions, phone calls, purchases. This shows which pages and keywords drive actual business results, not just traffic.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Competitor Analysis</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            See what's working for businesses similar to yours. Which keywords do they rank for? What content topics do they cover? This isn't about copying—it's about identifying gaps and opportunities in your market.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Tools like Google's autocomplete and "People Also Ask" sections reveal what questions customers have. Answer those questions better than your competitors, and you'll rank for them.
          </p>

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Finding the Right Web Design Partner in Columbia</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-4">
          Your website is often the first interaction potential customers have with your business. Getting it right matters—not just aesthetically, but functionally. The right design partner understands both your industry and your customers, builds sites that perform well, and creates something that actually represents your brand.
        </p>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
          Columbia has a growing community of web designers and developers, each with different strengths and specialties. Here's what to look for and which studios are worth considering.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What Separates Good Design from Generic Templates</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Not all web design is equal. Template-based sites from platforms like Wix or Squarespace serve a purpose, but they have limitations: restricted customization, slower performance, and a sameness that makes it hard to stand out. Custom development offers flexibility, but it requires the right expertise.
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Performance and Technical Excellence</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            A well-designed site loads quickly, works seamlessly on phones, and follows accessibility standards. Google prioritizes fast, mobile-friendly sites in search rankings. If a design studio doesn't mention Core Web Vitals, responsive design, or performance optimization, they're missing fundamental requirements.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Modern development frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte produce faster, more efficient code than older approaches. Ask potential partners what technology they use and why. The answer should focus on user experience and performance, not just what they're familiar with.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Strategic Design Thinking</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Good designers ask about your business goals before discussing aesthetics. Who are your customers? What actions do you want visitors to take? How does your site fit into your broader marketing strategy? Design decisions should stem from these answers, not from following current trends.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            This includes information architecture—how content is organized and presented. A beautiful site that's confusing to navigate doesn't serve its purpose. Strong studios balance visual design with clear user flows.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Brand Alignment and Custom Design</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Your website should feel cohesive with your brand identity—not like it was built from a pre-made template with your logo swapped in. Custom typography, thoughtful color systems, and unique layouts create differentiation in crowded markets.
          </p>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            For Columbia's creative businesses—coffee shops, boutiques, restaurants, local brands—this distinction matters. Generic websites communicate generic businesses. Custom design signals that you care about details and quality.

        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Questions to Ask Before Hiring</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Choosing a web design partner requires evaluating both capability and fit. Here are questions that reveal how studios work and whether they're right for your project.
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">About Their Process</h3>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>How do you approach new projects?</strong> Look for strategic thinking—questions about goals, audience, and business objectives before design discussions</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>What's your typical timeline?</strong> Realistic estimates matter. Custom sites take time. Be wary of promises that seem too fast</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>How do you handle revisions?</strong> Understand the revision process, how many rounds are included, and what happens if you need changes after launch</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Who owns the final files?</strong> You should own your website and all associated files. Some agencies retain ownership, limiting your future options</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">About Technology and Performance</h3>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>What technology do you build with and why?</strong> The answer should focus on performance, maintainability, and alignment with your needs—not just what they always use</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>How do you ensure mobile performance?</strong> Mobile-first design should be standard, not an add-on</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>What's your approach to SEO?</strong> Basic technical SEO should be built in. Be skeptical of agencies selling SEO as a separate monthly service without specifics</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>How do you handle accessibility?</strong> WCAG compliance matters for both ethical and legal reasons. Ask for specific practices</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">About Ongoing Support</h3>
          <ul class="list-unstyled ms-4 mb-3">
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>What happens after launch?</strong> Understand hosting, maintenance, and support options. Some agencies require monthly retainers; others offer flexible support</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>Can I update content myself?</strong> You should be able to make basic updates without developer help. Ask about training and documentation</li>
            <li class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-2"><strong>What's your response time for issues?</strong> Know what support looks like if something breaks or you need help</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">Red Flags to Watch For</h2>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Overpromising on SEO</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            No one can guarantee first-page Google rankings. Good technical SEO is foundational, but ongoing content and optimization work determines rankings. Be skeptical of guaranteed results or promises that sound too good.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Template-Based "Custom" Design</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Some studios use pre-built themes with minor customization and call it custom design. Ask to see their portfolio. If multiple sites look structurally similar, they're likely template-based. True custom design means building from scratch to match your brand.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Lack of Portfolio Specificity</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            Studios should clearly show their role in portfolio projects. Did they design it? Develop it? Both? If they can't articulate what they specifically contributed, they might be showing work they didn't actually create.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Pressure to Sign Quickly</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
            High-pressure sales tactics don't belong in creative partnerships. Quality studios will give you time to evaluate proposals, ask questions, and make informed decisions. Rush decisions often lead to regret.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mb-5">
        <h2 class="text-3xl mb-3">What to Expect in Terms of Investment</h2>
        <p class="text-md text-slate-700 mb-3">
          Web design pricing varies widely based on complexity, customization level, and studio expertise. Understanding typical ranges helps set realistic expectations.
        </p>
        
        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Template-Based Sites</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Platforms like Squarespace or WordPress themes: $500-$3,000. You get speed and low cost, but limited customization and template constraints. Good for very small businesses or temporary needs.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Semi-Custom Development</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            WordPress or similar platforms with custom design elements: $3,000-$10,000. More flexibility than templates, but still platform-dependent. Performance varies significantly based on implementation quality.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Fully Custom Development</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Built from scratch with modern frameworks: $8,000-$25,000+. Complete design control, optimized performance, and unique solutions tailored to your business. Higher upfront cost but better long-term value for businesses serious about their web presence.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-4">
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Enterprise Solutions</h3>
          <p class="text-md text-slate-700">
            Complex applications, e-commerce platforms, or multi-site systems: $25,000-$100,000+. For larger organizations with specific technical requirements and integration needs.
